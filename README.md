 Problem#35

  Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

        This problem was asked by Google.
	Given an array of strictly the characters 'R', 'G', and 'B',
	segregate the values of the array so that all the Rs come first,
	the Gs come second, and the Bs come last. You can only swap elements of the array.
	For example, given the array ['G', 'B', 'R', 'R', 'B', 'R', 'G'],
	it should become ['R', 'R', 'R', 'G', 'G', 'B', 'B'].

   Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.
   
    This problem was asked by Facebook.
    Given a array of numbers representing the stock prices of a company in chronological order,
    write a function that calculates the maximum profit you could have made from buying and selling that stock once.
    You must buy before you can sell it.
    For example, given [9, 11, 8, 5, 7, 10], you should return 5, 
    since you could buy the stock at 5 dollars and sell it at 10 dollars.

 Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.
 
     This problem was asked by Amazon.
     Given a string, find the longest palindromic contiguous substring.
     If there are more than one with the maximum length, return any one.
     For example, the longest palindromic substring of "aabcdcb" is "bcdcb". 
     The longest palindromic substring of "bananas" is "anana".

 Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.
  
    This problem was asked by Google.
    Implement an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache. It should be able to be initialized with a cache size n,
    and contain the following methods:
    set(key, value): sets key to value. If there are already n items in the cache and we are adding a new item, 
    then it should also remove the least recently used item.
    get(key): gets the value at key. If no such key exists, return null.
    Each operation should run in O(1) time.
